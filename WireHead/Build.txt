Wirehead Echo module by FNS Pedals

Moderate difficulty, not for beginners.

Problems:
Module cut off too many low tones, bass was almost gone. The solution was to increase the capacity of the input stage from 47n to 1u.
For some reason I had a number of cold soldered connectors. They looked good, but were'nt. It did cost a couple of hours just to find that.
The input stage was using a BC 549c which I replace by a FET 2N5457 (DSG pin orientation), most other FET with that pin ordering will probably do.

Lesson learnt: Do not solder at the gate of a FET when it is powered on... Lost 2 FETS by that. Plus the time to find out, that they were fried.

It is mandatory to find a blance of the signal amplitude going into the distortion and the amplitude going into feedback.
